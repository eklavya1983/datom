Adding nodes
-We will have addnode script
-This command will be run from the node itself
-It will do hardward discovery and report to config service
-It will also configure services to run
-After node is added to via config service, infromation returned from config service is stamped on the node

Service bootup
-Service will have following args
--nic_if, root, port, domain_name, service_name
-At root we expect json file with node information validated by config service.  This will contain node name for now
-Service init the following
-Coordination client
-Properties
-Connection cache
--expose getConnection().  Will first look in cache followed by zk. Returns future.
--register for updates for any connection in connection cache
-Create znode
-Publish it's up

Connection cache
-Connection cache runs in it's own eventbase
-Each connection also runs in it's own eventbase which is given to the async socket.


Config service
-First the user will have to create datom tree.  This will create a node with config serivce as an entry in the tree.
-When config service comes up it checks if path /datom/configservice exists.  If it exits, then it's an existing dataom instance.  Otherwise it's a fresh instance.
-Under /datom/configserivce/instance will be a znode that stays up until config service stays up
Handling errors
-We will return exceptions.  That way it's possible include descriptive error messages as well.  Same can be done with status code also.  But it'd require creating an error code for each case.
